# 🎯 TBA Design Philosophy

TBA is more than a game engine. It’s a bridge between generations, a toolkit for storytelling, and a safe space for emotional expression. Every mechanic, endpoint, and narrative hook is built with intention—to make digital play feel personal, cinematic, and connective.

## 🧭 Core Pillars

### 🎬 Cinematic Play
Every roll, reaction, and effect should feel like part of a story worth telling. TBA prioritizes expressive narration, replayable lore, and branching outcomes that reflect player choices.

### 🧱 Modular Simplicity
Tools should be powerful, but never overwhelming. TBA’s endpoints are designed to be composable, narratable, and easy to scaffold—whether you’re building a gritty cyberpunk heist or a whimsical forest quest.

### 💖 Emotional Resonance
Digital spaces should feel like home. TBA supports persistent memory, personalized actors, and storytelling that adapts to the emotional tone of the players.

## 👨‍👧 Dual-System Design

TBA is built for families and communities. It offers two modes:

- **Tools for the Bad Ass**: Mature, tactical, and gritty. Designed for adult players who want expressive combat and deep narrative control.
- **Tools for Being Awesome**: Kid-friendly, emotionally safe, and easy to learn. The same mechanics, softened for younger players and family play.

An age gate toggles between these modes, adjusting narration tone, chat filters, and UI language—so everyone can play together, safely and meaningfully.

## 🧠 Narrative-First Architecture

TBA treats mechanics as story generators. Every endpoint—from `/effect/apply` to `/chat/resolve`—is designed to produce narratable output. The system doesn’t just track stats; it tells stories.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Accessibility

- **Age Gating**: Filters harsh language and adjusts tone based on player age.
- **Spectator Mode**: Lets families watch stories unfold in real time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed for mobile, desktop, and Discord integration.
- **Expressive Error Handling**: Debug logs and schema validation are narratable too.

## 🧪 Playtest Origins

TBA was first in person playtested on a train—with a 7-year-old casting spells and narrating outcomes. That moment sparked the vision: a system that lets parents and kids play together, even when they’re apart.

---

## 🛠️ Development Ethos

- Build narratively, not just tactically.
- Prioritize emotional clarity over mechanical complexity.
- Design for connection, not just control.
- Every endpoint should feel like a story beat.

## 💬 Final Thought

TBA isn’t just a game system. It’s a way to stay connected—to your kids, your friends, your stories. Whether you’re rolling dice in a dark room or narrating spells over a video call, TBA is there to make the moment matter.
