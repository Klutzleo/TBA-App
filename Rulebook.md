INTRODUCTION
First of all, THANK YOU! Just getting to this point means the world to me. Tools for the Bad Ass (TBA) is designed to get you playing fast and reward creative thinking. This isn't about min-maxing stats or memorizing spell lists. It's about telling stories where your choices matter and thinking outside the box gets rewarded.
Every skill you can imagine—no, seriously, ANY skill—is simplified into three core abilities: Intellect, Physical, and Social. No flipping through character sheets to find the right skill. If you want to do it, roll for it. Don't be afraid to try anything.
What Makes TBA Different:
Dice vs Dice: No difficulty classes. You roll against opponents, so even weaker rolls can succeed if you roll better than the defense!
Simple Stats: Three numbers (1, 2, 3) define your character. That's it.
Bad Ass Power: Bonuses for creative, cinematic actions.
Unified Magic & Techniques: Same mechanics for spells and special abilities.
Emotional Stakes: Tethers and The Calling add narrative weight to dangerous moments.

CORE MECHANICS
Damage Points (DP)
Damage Points represent your character's ability to keep fighting. When you take damage, you subtract it from your DP. At 0 DP, you're knocked out. Going negative can trigger The Calling.
Negative DP:
0 to -9 DP: You’re unconscious and can’t act until healed.
-10 DP or worse: The Calling begins. Roll to survive or narrate your final moment.
The Three Abilities
Every character has three core stats. You assign the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to these three areas. That's your character's baseline—it never changes.
Intellect (IP)
Every skill you would use your brain to complete—thinking, investigating, researching, knowledge checks, magic spells, hacking, and strategy. Have fun with it, think outside the box. Don't be afraid to roll an IP check for ANYTHING.
Physical (PP)
Every skill you would use your physical body to complete—attacking, jumping, climbing, sneaking, etc. But also how your body reacts to things like extreme cold, hunger, poison, and being wounded. You could also use a Physical roll to show off your strength or try to stay sober in a drinking contest.
Social (SP)
Every skill to talk to another character or talk your way out of situations. You can use it as charisma or persuasion. Just flexing muscles isn't usually enough to intimidate—you'll need to add a little Social power to get that point across that you mean business. Pairing a Social roll with either an IP or PP roll can help in a sticky situation.
Edge
Edge is your experience bonus. It starts at 0 and increases by +1 every even level (max +5 at level 10). Edge applies to every roll—skills, combat, magic, everything. The leveling table will give you exactly what you need!
Bad Ass Power (BAP)
Bad Ass Power (BAP) rewards creativity and cinematic moments. When you describe an action that's bold, clever, or narratively awesome, the Story Weaver can grant you BAP as a bonus to your roll.
Could it be sliding under a closing door while firing backward? Could it be using the environment creatively, like swinging from a chandelier? Could it be delivering a one-liner before a critical moment? Could it be creating a distraction so the rest of the party can accomplish their goal? Could it be sacrificing yourself to save the world?
These are just examples of cool events that could shape a whole campaign, battle, or an in-the-moment idea you have. If the Story Weaver approves of your badassery, they'll tell you to add your BAP to your roll. This could help with any Intellect, Physical, or Social roll, as well as in combat.
BAP starts at +1 and increases as you level (max +5 at level 10). See the leveling table for your current BAP bonus.

HOW TO PLAY
The Core Roll
Formula:
1d6 + Relevant Ability (IP/PP/SP) + Edge + BAP (if granted)
You're always rolling against something—an opponent's roll, the environment, or a Story Weaver's difficulty roll.
Skill Rolls and Checks
Some actions could fit multiple stats. Intimidation could be Physical (flexing muscles) or Social (threatening words). The Story Weaver and player decide together, which makes sense—have fun figuring out creative combinations!
When there's resistance (an NPC trying to stop you), it's a contested roll—your roll vs theirs. When there's no direct opposition (climbing a wall), the Story Weaver rolls for the environment/difficulty. Think of it like rolling against the situation itself.

COMBAT
Initiative
Everyone rolls 1d6 + Physical + Edge. The highest goes first. In the case of a tie, go in order of who has the higher base physical stat. Still have a tie? Continue to higher Intellect, then Social. If there’s still a tie, put whoever brings the best snacks to the play session first. (It’s in the rules now. Use this to your advantage, Story Weavers!)
Making an Attack
Attacks use Weapon Dice instead of 1d6. Weapon dice range from 1d4 to 1d12, depending on your level. The leveling table will show what's available to you at each level.
Formula:
Weapon Die + Physical + Edge vs Defense Die + Physical + Edge
If your attack roll beats the defender's defense roll, subtract the difference from the defender's DP. This means even weaker rolls can succeed if you roll better than the defense!
Example: You have a sword (1d6). You roll 4, add Physical 3 and Edge 1 = 8 total. The enemy has Defense Die 1d6, rolls 2, adds Physical 1 and Edge 1 = 4 total. 8 - 4 = 4 damage to enemy DP.
Magic Weapons & Bonuses
Magic weapons and armor add flat bonuses to your rolls. A +2 sword adds +2 to your attack roll. A +1 shield adds +1 to defense. These bonuses will stack with all other bonuses on your rolls.

MAGIC & TECHNIQUES
Magic and Techniques work identically. The only difference: Magic users rely on Intellect; Technique users rely on Physical or Social.
Both systems:
Use the same dice progression (1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, 2d6, 2d8)
Limited uses per encounter (3 per level, so 30 at level 10)
Gained at levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Each spell/technique slot has its own die progression based on your level, as shown in the Leveling Table.
Using Magic or Techniques
Magic and techniques roll the same way as attacks. Roll your spell/technique die + Intellect or Physical + Edge.
For attacks, roll against the target's Defense Die. For healing, the roll is the total amount healed. For buffs/debuffs, consult the table below.
The Five Slots
Your five magic/technique slots determine what effects you can create:
1st Slot (Single Target): Your first magic spell or technique, which will become your most powerful. 
2nd Slot (Area of Effect): Affects multiple targets. Use carefully—allies can be hit too! It can also be used for mass buffs/debuffs.
3rd Slot (Single Target): Same options as 1st slot.
4th Slot (Area of Effect): Same options as 2nd slot.
5th Slot (Single Target): Same options as the 1st and 3rd slots. 
Healing
Roll your spell die + Intellect + Edge. The total is how much DP you restore. No contested roll needed.
Buffs and Debuffs
Buffs and Debuffs are a little different than regular Spells or Techniques. When you want to perform a Buff, it just happens; no rolling is needed. You just need to refer to the table below regarding what-sized die for that level spell or tier of item. 
Debuffs, on the other hand, will need to be rolled for and defended against the corresponding stat related to that spell.
For example, you want a 'Fear' debuff that frightens the enemies to make their attacks weaker. Since fear, in general, is mind-related, you would roll with your Intellect skill, and they would roll against using their Intellect skill. Granted, that is, if the "Fear" you create is from your mind. If it is Physical, then you roll with your Physical skill.
Now, what buffs or debuffs are or do is again up to you and your Story Weaver. You can add a modifier to Defense Die or Weapon Die, speed up or slow down a character, blind, confuse, stun, etc.
Depending on what level you are and when you selected the spell (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th) or tier of item, look to the Leveling Table or Consumable Table to see what die is rolled; this will determine the modifier added. 
The buffs or debuffs will last the number of rounds the +/- modifier is. For example, +/- 2 will last for two rounds.
Buff/Debuff Table:
1d6: +/-1
1d8: +/-2
1d10: +/-3
1d12: +/-4
2d6: +/-5
2d8: +/-6

TETHERS
Tethers are emotional anchors—beliefs, fears, bonds, or traumas that define who your character is. They're not chosen at character creation. They emerge through play.
A character can have 1–3 Tethers. They evolve as the story progresses.
Examples of Tethers:
"I never leave a teammate behind..."
"Magic destroyed my family…"
"I will prove I'm more than my father's shadow..."
"I fear the dark because of what happened there…"
How Tethers Work
When a Tether is relevant, it triggers a bonus or penalty. The Story Weaver determines when a Tether activates and chooses a buff/debuff level (1-5) based on how emotionally significant the moment is. Use the same buff/debuff table as Magic & Techniques:
1st Level: +1/-1
2nd Level: +2/-2
3rd Level: +3/-3
4th Level: +4/-4
5th Level: +5/-5
Example: A character with the Tether "Sworn to protect my sister" gets +3 when defending her (3rd level buff), but -2 when separated from her (2nd level debuff).
Tethers can change. Trauma, triumph, or revelation can create new Tethers or transform existing ones.

THE CALLING
When a character reaches -10 DP or worse, they enter The Calling—a liminal space between life and death.
This is the moment where your story could end. But it doesn't have to.
Story Weaver Prompts for The Calling
Ask the player:
"What do you see in this moment between life and death?"
"What do you fight to return to?"
"What unfinished business keeps you here?"
"If this is the end, what are your final words?"
BAP can be awarded within The Calling for incredible answers.
The Roll
Roll 1d6 + Intellect or Social (player's choice) + Edge vs Story Weaver's difficulty roll:
Levels 1-3: Story Weaver rolls 1d6
Levels 4-6: Story Weaver rolls 1d8
Levels 7-9: Story Weaver rolls 1d10
Level 10: Story Weaver rolls 1d12
This keeps The Calling dangerous even at high levels!
Outcomes
Win by 1-3: You survive but are Marked by Death. Take a permanent scar, trauma, or limitation.
Win by 4+: You survive and return to 1 DP. No permanent consequences.
Lose: Your character dies. Narrate your final moment and create a Memory Echo.
Marked by Death
If you win The Calling by 1-3, you gain a permanent mark:
A physical scar or injury
A trauma or fear
A limitation (can't use one technique, loses 1 max DP, etc.)
This becomes a new Tether.
Memory Echo
When a character dies, their final act leaves a Memory Echo—a lingering effect that alters the story world:
A dying wish that must be fulfilled
A secret revealed in their last breath
A curse or blessing that affects the party
An item or power is transferred to another character

The Called
When you survive The Calling and are Marked by Death, you gain the status "The Called." This represents the lingering connection to death—sometimes manifesting as nightmares, sometimes as prophetic visions.
1st Time Called:
When: Randomly during rests (Story Weaver's discretion)
Roll 1d6:
1-2: Nightmare. Take -1 to your next roll
3-5: Peaceful sleep. No effect
6: Prophetic vision. Gain +1 to your next roll
2nd Time Called:
When: More frequent
During rests (more often)
Randomly during adventuring (Story Weaver's discretion)
Roll: Same 1d6 table as above
3rd and 4th Time Called:
When: Very frequent
During rests
During adventuring
Even during battle (Story Weaver discretion)
Roll: Same 1d6 table
5th Time:
There is no 5th time. You're permanently dead.
No more chances at The Calling.
Clearing The Called Status
You can keep this status (some players appreciate the chance for the +1), OR you can seek cleansing:
Complete a spiritual quest
Visit a holy site/healer
Perform a ritual (Story Weaver determines requirements)
Once cleansed, “The Called” status is removed, but your "death counter" remains the same.


CHARACTER CREATION
Creating a character takes minutes. No race restrictions, no class limitations. Be who you want.
Step 1: Concept
Who are you? A space cowboy with finger guns? A street mage with a vendetta? A diplomat who talks their way through everything? Pick an archetype or create your own. Have fun with it!
Step 2: Assign Stats
Assign 1, 2, and 3 to Intellect, Physical, and Social. Your highest number (3) goes to your primary ability—what your character is best at. That's it. These numbers never change; you just add Edge as you level.
Step 3: Choose Starting Equipment
At level 1, you start with a weapon (1d6) and armor (Defense Die 1d6). Choose the type based on your character and setting.
Beyond that, your character may have whatever makes sense for who they are and where the story begins. A street detective may have a notepad and a flashlight. A space marine may have rations and a comms unit. A fantasy knight may have a rope and a bedroll. Work with your Story Weaver—if it makes sense for your character to have it, you have it.
These items don't grant mechanical bonuses; they're tools for your story.
Step 4: Play
That's it. Start playing. Seriously, you're done. Go be bad ass.

LEVELING
Characters level up when the Story Weaver determines they've earned it—usually after major story beats, completed quests, or surviving significant challenges.
What You Gain Each Level:
More DP (increases every level)
Better weapon/defense dice (check leveling table)
Edge bonus (every even level: +1 Edge)
BAP bonus (increases with level)
New magic/technique slot (at levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
More uses per encounter (3 per level)
Consult the leveling table for exact numbers at each level.

ITEMS & EQUIPMENT
Weapons & Armor
Weapons and armor are defined by their dice. The leveling table shows which dice are available at your level; the type of weapon does not determine the roll or the outcome. It is more for flavor until you can get upgraded weapons or armor.
Multi-Die Weapons
As you level up, the Leveling Table shows options for multi-die weapons (like 2d4, 3d6, 2d8). These represent burst fire, dual-wielding, heavy weapons, magical enhancement, or any concept that makes sense for multiple strikes.
How They Work:
Multi-die weapons attack multiple times in a single action. Roll all your weapon dice, add your stats and Edge to each die, and compare each attack to the defender's rolls. The defender must roll defense separately for each attack. Each successful attack deals damage equal to the difference.
Risk vs Reward:
Multi-die weapons are high-risk, high-reward:
More attacks = more chances to hit (great against tough enemies)
But rolling low on multiple dice can waste your turn (several weak attacks might all miss)
Single high-die weapons (1d12) are more consistent (one powerful strike)
Multi-die weapons (3d6) are more volatile (could devastate or disappoint)
Weapon Flavor Examples:
The dice determine mechanics; the weapon description is entirely yours. A 3d6 weapon could be a machine gun, triple-strike sword technique, or conjured magic missiles. A 1d12 could be a greataxe, sniper rifle, or channeled lightning bolt. Choose what fits your character and setting.
At each level, choose ONE weapon die option from your Leveling Table. You can switch weapons between sessions with your Story Weaver's approval. Multi-die options typically appear at higher levels, representing more powerful or exotic weapons.
Upgraded Weapons & Armor
Upgraded weapons and armor add flat bonuses (+1, +2, +3) to attack and defense rolls. The Story Weaver determines availability and power, whether through purchase, epic loot, or some other way to earn it.
Consumables & Tools
Healing potions, grenades, tech gadgets—these are narrative tools. Work with your Story Weaver to determine effects. Most grant one-time bonuses or heal fixed amounts of DP. 
The list below will explain the rolls or debuffs for consumables and tools. It is very similar to the buff and debuff list for magic and techniques, as the +/- modifier is the length of rounds it lasts. 
They are listed here as “Tiers,” but please add your own flavor in your own world Story Weavers!
Tier 1: 1d6 or +/-1
Tier 2: 1d8 or +/-2
Tier 3: 1d10 or +/-3
Tier 4: 1d12 or +/-4
Tier 5: 2d6 or +/-5
Tier 6: 2d8 or +/-6

For healing potions or stim packs, there are no rolls; you would take the full healing as if you rolled the “max” die. For example, Tier 1 is 1d6; you would gain 6 DP. If it were Tier 6, you would gain 16 DP (8+8=16).

PETS, ALLIES, AND SUMMONS
Pets
Pets are the most basic form of companionship. They can be bought, raised, or found in the wild. They can be anything you want as long as they are within a reasonable size. A dog, a cat, a housefly, a small robot, whatever you wish. This does need to make sense to you, your Story Weaver, and your campaign setting.
Pets are fun little creatures and fun story elements, but they do have a setback: they are unable to assist in battle, and they can die. Think of pets as more of cosmetic items than creatures that could grant you some sort of bonus.
Allies
Allies are much different than pets. These creatures or people have a special bond to you and will go to the ends of whatever planet you're on for you. There is one prerequisite needed before you can have access to your companion: you'll need to take your first technique for your character as "Ally." This will, unfortunately, take your most powerful technique slot, but in return, you are gaining a very powerful companion.
An Ally could be any creature your mind can think of that fits your game setting. But please remember, this becomes a second "character" for you to play. You will be responsible for all role-playing and die rolls for this Ally. Allies level up with your character, though they have their own leveling table (see Ally Leveling Table). They also follow the same death and damage rules as player characters.
Building Your Ally
When you gain an Ally, you build them like a character:
Stats: Assign IP/PP/SP using the same 1/2/3 distribution as player characters. Choose which stat gets which value based on your Ally's nature (a wolf might be PP:3, IP:2, SP:1; a wise owl might be IP:3, SP:2, PP:1).
Combat: Allies use their own stats, Edge, BAP, and dice from the Ally Leveling Table for all rolls. Allies can earn Bad Ass Power for creative, heroic, or dramatic actions just like player characters, using their BAP bonus from the Ally Leveling Table. Allies have lower DP than player characters (roughly 80% at each level) to balance their additional combat presence—you're effectively controlling two combatants.
Abilities: Allies can use weapons, armor, and magical items if it makes sense for their form (discuss with your Story Weaver). They can also learn spells or techniques using their own spell/technique slots shown on the Ally Leveling Table.
Commands: Allies understand any order you (or others, if you wish) give them, though success may depend on skill checks. They act on their own initiative in combat.
Ally Death
If your Ally dies permanently (after The Calling), it causes a negative Tether called Emptiness (see Tethers section). This represents the profound loss and grief of losing your bonded companion.
Allies follow The Calling rules just like player characters. They can survive near-death, become Marked by Death, and gain The Called status. If they die heroically, a Memory Echo may be created to honor their sacrifice.

Summons
Summons are temporary creatures/wards called through magic and require your first spell slot just like an Ally. You choose the flavor of magic they are using. They take a full round to summon, and -1 DP per round to maintain. They also match your limitations on how many spells they can use per encounter, listed in the Magic and Techniques section.
Summons use your spell dice + Intellect + Edge for attacks/healing.
Summon Durability:
Levels 1-3: Disappears after 1 hit
Levels 4-6: Disappears after 2 hits
Levels 7-9: Disappears after 3 hits
Level 10: Disappears after 4 hits

VEHICLES
Not every campaign will utilize a vehicle, but if the need arises, you're covered. Vehicles use the Vehicle Leveling Table and can level up alongside the party, representing upgrades, modifications, and the crew's growing mastery.

Vehicle Leveling

Vehicles level up when the party levels up. Story Weavers may also grant vehicle levels as rewards for major upgrades (installing new weapons, reinforcing armor) or story milestones (claiming a legendary ship, completing a major overhaul).
A Level 1 bike doesn't become a battleship—it becomes a badass Level 10 bike with nitro boosters, reinforced plating, and mounted weapons. A Level 1 battleship starts powerful but becomes a legendary flagship as it levels.
Vehicles have higher Edge progression (0-10 instead of 0-5) because they represent technological or magical superiority that scales beyond individual skill. A legendary starship's targeting systems, a mech's advanced combat programming, or an enchanted airship's arcane enhancements provide mechanical advantages that exceed what characters can achieve alone.

Vehicle Systems (Spells & Techniques)
Vehicles may have special systems, weapons, or capabilities that function like spells or techniques. These represent advanced technology, magical enhancements, or specialized equipment installed on the vehicle.
Examples:
A spaceship's shield boost system (defensive buff)
A mech's missile barrage (area attack)
A warship's targeting computer (accuracy buff)
An airship's emergency thruster (evasion maneuver)
How They Work:
Vehicle systems use the same spell/technique rules as characters:
Each system uses a spell/technique slot from the Vehicle Leveling Table
Uses per encounter are shared across all vehicle systems (based on vehicle level)
Crew members activate systems on their turn using their stats + the vehicle's spell die
Effects follow the same buff/debuff mechanics as character abilities
The crew determines which systems to install and when to use them. Discuss vehicle capabilities with your Story Weaver during vehicle creation or upgrades.
Note: When operating a vehicle, use the vehicle's Edge from the Vehicle Leveling Table instead of your character's Edge. The vehicle's systems and capabilities determine performance.
Single-Pilot Vehicles

For single-pilot vehicles (speeder bike, fighter, mech), the pilot uses their own stats combined with the vehicle's capabilities:
Vehicle vs Vehicle Combat:
Attack: Vehicle Weapon Die + PP + Vehicles’ Edge vs the enemy's Defense
Defense: Vehicle Defense Die + PP + Vehicle's Edge vs incoming attacks
Maneuvers: 1d6 + PP + Vehicles’ Edge for stunts, evasion, or contested piloting
Vehicle vs Person Combat:
Attack: Vehicle Weapon Die + PP + Vehicles’ Edge vs enemy's Defense Die + PP + Edge
Defense: Vehicle Defense Die + PP + Vehicles’ Edge vs incoming attacks
Damage goes to the vehicle's DP. The pilot's character stats determine skill; the vehicle provides firepower and durability.

Multi-Crew Vehicles

Large vehicles (spaceships, warships, airships) require multiple crew members operating different stations. Each crew member operates a station using their character stats combined with the ship's capabilities:
GUNNER (Attack):
Roll: Ship's Weapon Die + PP + Vehicles’ Edge vs enemy Defense
Effect: Deal damage on a successful hit
ARMOR/DEFENSE OFFICER (Defense):
Roll: Ship's Defense Die + PP + Vehicles’ Edge vs incoming attacks
Effect: Defend against enemy fire
CAPTAIN (Support - Social):
Roll: 1d6 + SP + Vehicles’ Edge
Effect: Buff either Attack or Defense (player's choice) - add roll result as bonus to Gunner or Defense Officer's next roll
PILOT (Support - Intellect):
Roll: 1d6 + IP + Vehicles’ Edge
Effect: Buff either Attack or Defense through positioning - add roll result as a bonus to the Gunner or the Defense Officer's next roll
ENGINEER (Repair):
Roll: 1d6 + IP + Vehicles’ Edge
Effect: Restore DP to the ship equal to the roll result
FLEXIBILITY: These are suggested stat pairings. If you can justify why a different stat makes sense for your vehicle or situation (maybe piloting a nimble fighter is Physical, or your engineer uses Social to rally the crew), discuss it with your Story Weaver. Make it work for your story!

Multi-Crew Combat Round

Each crew member acts on their own initiative (rolled at combat start: 1d6 + Physical + Physical Edge). On their turn, they perform their station's action. If a station is unmanned, that function doesn't happen that round. A ship with no engineer can't make repairs. A ship with no dedicated armor officer uses only the vehicle's base Defense Die with no character stat or Edge added.

Vehicle Damage

Damage goes to the vehicle's DP, not the crew. At 0 DP, the vehicle is disabled. At -10 DP or worse, the vehicle is critically damaged—catastrophic failure is imminent (hull breach, engine explosion, systems failure). The Story Weaver determines what happens based on the situation.
Crew members inside take damage only if the Story Weaver rules that specific attacks breach the hull or target the crew directly.
