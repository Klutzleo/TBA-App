Database migrations for TBA-App

Migration scripts should be numbered sequentially: 001_description.py, 002_description.py, etc.

Each migration should:
1. Be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
2. Include both upgrade and rollback logic
3. Check for existing tables/columns before modifying
4. Log all changes clearly
