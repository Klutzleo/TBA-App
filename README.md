# TBA — A Modular, Cinematic RPG Platform

**TBA** is a narrative-first digital RPG system designed for fast onboarding, expressive play, and emotionally resonant storytelling. Built from the ground up to support custom mechanics, modular tools, and immersive scene management, TBA empowers GMs and players to craft unforgettable moments—whether around a virtual campfire or across a sprawling campaign.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

TBA is built on three pillars:

- **Cinematic Play**: Every roll, reaction, and scene should feel like part of a story worth telling.
- **Modular Simplicity**: Tools should be powerful, but never overwhelming.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Digital spaces should feel like home—personal, persistent, and expressive.

## 🧠 Status

This project is in active development. The core system is being shaped through structured schemas, playtest feedback, and iterative design. UI and hosting layers will be added once the emotional and mechanical foundations are solid.

> ⚠️ TBA is currently in an early development phase. While the repository is public for visibility and deployment purposes, contributions are paused while foundational systems are refined. Feel free to follow progress or reach out with questions.
