# TBA — A Modular, Cinematic RPG Platform

**TBA** is a narrative-first digital RPG system designed for fast onboarding, expressive play, and emotionally resonant storytelling. Built from the ground up to support custom mechanics, modular tools, and immersive scene management, TBA empowers GMs and players to craft unforgettable moments—whether around a virtual campfire or across a sprawling campaign.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

TBA is built on three pillars:

- **Cinematic Play**: Every roll, reaction, and scene should feel like part of a story worth telling.
- **Modular Simplicity**: Tools should be powerful, but never overwhelming.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Digital spaces should feel like home—personal, persistent, and expressive.
