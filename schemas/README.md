## üß© Schema Principles

- **Modular**: Each JSON is self-contained and cross-referenced via IDs  
- **Flat**: No deep nesting‚Äîeasy to parse, store, and query  
- **Expressive**: Emotional flags, memory markers, and narrative tags are first-class citizens  
- **Reactive**: Supports tether triggers, Calling events, and echo propagation  
- **Privacy-Aware**: Visibility flags (`public`, `private`, `mixed`) on all sensitive fields

---

## üß∑ Field Conventions

- `*_id`: Unique identifiers for linking across schemas  
- `visibility`: Controls UI exposure and sharing  
- `tags`: Thematic or emotional metadata for filtering and surfacing  
- `origin_event`, `session_id`: Traceable emotional lineage  
- `bonus`, `effect`: Mechanical impact of emotional triggers

## üß† Emotional Mechanics

| Mechanic        | JSON Source           | Description                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tethers**     | `tether_registry.json`| Emotional anchors that trigger bonuses or penalties       |
| **The Calling** | `calling_log.json`    | Death threshold mechanic with narrative consequences      |
| **Memory Echoes**| `memory_echoes.json` | Persistent effects from trauma or triumph                 |
| **Marked by Death**| `character_profile.json` | Status effect after surviving The Calling             |
| **BAP Triggers**| `bap_registry.json`   | Narrative bonuses granted by Story Weaver creativity      |

## üßô Author Note

This schema honors memory, agency, and emotional safety. It‚Äôs not just a data model‚Äîit‚Äôs a mythic machine built to remember what mattered.
